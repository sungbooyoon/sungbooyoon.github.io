The objective of this study is to pioneer new construction markets in local and overseas through the development of modular construction methods and implement modular construction methods for mid to high-rise buildings to improve productivity significantly in building industries as well as pursuing technology developments to enhance productivity. The detailed R&D objectives are as follows. Development of transportation methods reflecting the characteristics of mid to high-rise modular buildings to factory-manufactured modular units / Development of technology for site construction efficiency to build mid to high-rise modular buildings / Development of analysis methods to evaluate economic feasibility of modular buildings considering maintenance. In this study, buildings are clasifed into residential, quasi-residential, and non-residential considering the study target range, “modular buildings that can be applied to various facilties” and its aims are to implement a demonstration complex to have 15-story or higher modular buildings. The detailed contents of the main research and development are as follows. To develop expandable modular systems that can reduce transport volume for oversea expansion and to achieve market promotion of modular buildings by developing site lifting and construction technologies for mid to high-rise modular buildings. 1) Development of technology for transport efficiency of unit modules - In land transport guidelines to prevent damage to pre-manufactured modules - Expandable module systems to reduce transport volume (lift-up module, sliding module) 2) Development of optimization of site construction process - Mid to high-rise module construction process. - Site lifting planning and technology of safety management - Technology of optimization of equipment and work force operation - Joint equipment to enhance efficiency of installation at the site. 3) Analysis of economic feasibility of mid-rise buildings according to modular  construction method application - Analysis of economic feasibility of mid-rise building per use purpose(apartment, dormitory, or hotel). This study is to pioneer a new construction market in local and overseas through the technology development of mid to high-rise building modular construction methods and construct a foundation to enter oversea markets through innovative productivity improvements in construction industry as well as responding to various consumers demands. It aims to ensure long-term competitiveness of construction industry and pursue ensuring core technologies of high value added through mid to high-rise modular building design and engineering technology development.
