### Research Objectives
A construction robot platform will be developed to support three specialized high-altitude tasksâ€”**welding**, **painting**, and **fireproof spraying**â€”through **XR-based remote human-robot collaboration** and a **multi-robot integrated operation system**, improving safety and productivity on construction sites.
- **(Subtask 1 - MOLIT, KRW 17B)** Development of Human-Robot Collaboration and Integrated Operating System for Construction Work at Height
- **(Subtask 2 - MOTIE, KRW 11B)** Development of autonomous work at construction sites and multi-robot autonomous driving technology

## Core Technologies

### ðŸ”¹ Core Technology 1 â€“ MOLIT  
**XR-Based Human-Robot Collaboration for High-Altitude Tasks**  
- Develop and validate specialized robotic solutions for welding, painting, and fireproof spraying at height.  
- Integrate XR-based remote collaboration techniques to enhance task efficiency and worker safety.

### ðŸ”¹ Core Technology 2 â€“ MOTIE  
**Robotic Systems for High-Altitude Construction Operations**  
- Design modular mobile robots customized for construction environments, including high-altitude lift modules and general-purpose manipulators.  
- Develop advanced control technologies for environment perception, path planning, and autonomous navigation.

### ðŸ”¹ Core Technology 3 â€“ MOLIT  
**Integrated Operating System for High-Altitude Robotics**  
- Build and operate a **smart construction robot testbed (TB)** to verify real-world deployment.  
- Demonstrate a digital twin-based integrated operation system to manage high-altitude construction robots.

## Key Directions

### 1. Adaptive Autonomy-Level Operating System  
Deploy an operating system that supports flexible control modesâ€”from full autonomy (navigation, task execution) to partial automation (teleoperation, remote control)â€”based on on-site infrastructure, digitalization level, and task complexity.

### 2. Korea's First National Construction Robotics Testbed in Gimje
Establish Koreaâ€™s largest XR-based **smart site testbed** in the **Gimje Horizon Industrial Complex**, enabling one-stop support across: Technology development â†’ Prototyping â†’ Testing & certification â†’ Demonstration â†’ Commercialization

### 3. Three-Phase Research Framework with MOLIT & MOTIE
Coordinate R&D efforts through:
- **Phase 1**: Core technology development using commercial robot platforms  
- **Phase 2**: System integration and demonstration using developed robots  
- **Phase 3**: Deployment and activation through proof-of-concept (PoC) validation  

Phase 1 and 2 will be executed in parallel to maximize synergy between MOLIT and MOTIE projects.

### 4. Integrated Consortium for Inter-Ministerial Collaboration  
Establish a balanced consortium comprising industry leaders, academia, research institutes, and government agencies, focused on delivering practical, field-oriented technology outcomes, accelerating commercialization, and driving the standardization of robotic systems for construction.
