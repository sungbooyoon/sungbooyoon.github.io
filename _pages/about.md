I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Architecture & Architectural Engineering at Seoul National University. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Changbum R. Ahn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PJfny7sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and I am a Graduate Research Assistant at the university. My research interests span the fields of Construction Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction, and Teleoperation. My research goal is to develop innovative interfaces that enhance human-robot collaboration on construction sites, facilitating efficient and effective interaction.

I previously completed my undergraduate and master's degrees in Architectural Engineering at Seoul National University, where I graduated with honors and conducted research on spatial communication in human-robot collaboration. I have had the pleasure of contributing to several peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings, and I have been involved in patenting advanced systems for modular construction and human-robot interaction.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
