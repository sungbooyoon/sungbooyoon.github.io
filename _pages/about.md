I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Architecture & Architectural Engineering](https://architecture.snu.ac.kr/) at Seoul National University. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Changbum R. Ahn, and I am a member of the [Construction Engineering & Management Lab](https://cem.snu.ac.kr/). My research interests span the fields of Construction Robotics and Machine Learning. My research goal is to design innovative interfaces that enhance human-robot collaboration on construction sites, facilitating efficient and effective interaction.

I previously completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees in Architectural Engineering at Seoul National University, where I conducted research on modular construction and human-robot interaction under the advisement of Professor [Moonseo Park](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lkrSqmIAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am honored to be a recipient of the [Basic Science Research Program](https://www.nrf.re.kr/biz/info/info/view?menu_no=378&biz_no=416) (Ph.D. Fellowship) from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF).
