Hello! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidte in the [Department of Architecture & Architectural Engineering](https://architecture.snu.ac.kr/) at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/). I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Changbum R. Ahn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PJfny7sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and I am a member of the [Construction Engineering & Management Lab](https://cem.snu.ac.kr/). My research interests include construction robotics, human-robot interaction, and robot learning. I have published 10+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QFeaFbwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fsungbooyoon%2Fsungbooyoon.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> in major international journals and conferences in civil engineering, including Automation in Construction, JCEM, JCCE, and Advanced Engineering Informatics. I am passionate about bringing ideas into reality and developing systems that have tangible impacts on the work and safety of real human workers on construction sites.

I previously completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees in Architectural Engineering at Seoul National University, where I conducted research on modular construction and human-robot interaction under the advisement of Professor [Moonseo Park](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lkrSqmIAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am honored to be a recipient of the [Basic Science Research Program](https://www.nrf.re.kr/biz/info/info/view?menu_no=378&biz_no=416) (Ph.D. Fellowship) from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF).

Currently, I serve as a student coordinator of a joint project funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport & Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, South Korea, on developing a multipurpose robotic platform and XR-based humanâ€“robot collaboration system for construction work at height.
