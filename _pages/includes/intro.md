Hello! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidte in the [Department of Architecture & Architectural Engineering](https://architecture.snu.ac.kr/) at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/). I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Changbum R. Ahn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PJfny7sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and I am a member of the [Construction Engineering & Management Lab](https://cem.snu.ac.kr/). My research bridges construction robotics and human-robot interaction, with a focus on enabling robots to learn from and collaborate with human workers.

I previously completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees in Architectural Engineering at Seoul National University, where I conducted research on modular construction and human-robot interaction under the advisement of Professor [Moonseo Park](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lkrSqmIAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am honored to be a recipient of the [Basic Science Research Program](https://www.nrf.re.kr/biz/info/info/view?menu_no=378&biz_no=416) (Ph.D. Fellowship) from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF).

Currently, I serve as a student coordinator of a joint project funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport & Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, South Korea, on developing a multipurpose robotic platform and XR-based humanâ€“robot collaboration system for construction work at height.
