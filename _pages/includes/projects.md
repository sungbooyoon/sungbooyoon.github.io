- Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency (KOSHA), [Development of construction site smart safety model factory and evaluation standards](https://cem.snu.ac.kr/research/79), 2023-05-22 ~ 2023-11-30
  - Established evaluation criteria for smart safety equipment and guidelines for field implementation
  - Collected feedback from construction workers, safety managers, equipment manufacturers, IT companies, and government representatives

- Seoul National University, [Interactive Communication System for Human-Robot Collaboration in Construction](https://cem.snu.ac.kr/research/25), 2021-10-01 ~ 2023-09-30
  - Proposed a new interface which can provide an effective and intuitive means of operating construction robots, enabling construction workers to communicate spatial goals without the need for extensive training in robotics
  - Proposed a method to accurately infer the distant, human-indicated spatial goals by estimating the laser trajectories
