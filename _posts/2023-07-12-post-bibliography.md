This post shows how to add bibliography to simple blog posts. We support every citation style that [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) does. That means simple citation like {% cite yoon2023effects %}, multiple citations like {% cite yoon2023effects yoon2023effects %}, long references like {% reference yoon2023effects %} or also quotes:

{% quote yoon2023effects %}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing.
{% endquote %}
